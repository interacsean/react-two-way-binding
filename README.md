# react two way binding

This seeks to give React some of the benefits that Angular's two-way-binding concepts give.

See example.js for usage


## Todo
- Add tests
- Customise the callback prop (e.g. alternatives to onChange, for other inputs or Components), by providing optional 'bindOn' param, or another function twoWayBindOn(handler, component, ...)
- Provide post-compiled ES5 version for compatibility
- Look at refactoring for use in SFCs; is this possible, probably not what with state and all
